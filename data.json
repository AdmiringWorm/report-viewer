    "details": "Testing new Elastic Search feature using chocolatey API calls",
    "notes":  [
        "When calling the API the returned results may change depending on the order being used (not talking about the ordering itself), a similar thing happens on the production website, so mainly leaving it here so we are aware of it to look into in the future.\n- When calling the command `choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with` the API will return 25 packages found.\n- When calling the command `choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with --order-by-popularity` only 5 packages will be found.",
        "If you search for `choco` it finds a number of results, with chocolatey being far down the list. If you search for `chocol` it finds a single result that appears to have a typo in the description.\n\n- Another example is searching for `intune` and `intun` (today intun returns a single result and intune returns 0 results=.",
        "If you mouse over a result and then hit enter, it will often take you to that result instead of searching what you typed in\n\n- Example: type `adobe`, then mouse over `adobereader` and press `enter`. It will try to take you to the adobe reader package\n- Initially I thought this was happening after mousing off of the entry, but it seems to happening only if you keep the mouse over the package in question.",
        "Software source is not included in the API results when calling `choco info` (`choco info firefox used`)",
        "Identifier returned in the API results do not contain the original case of the software (`choco info innosetup` for instance uses upper case `I` and `S` which shows up correctly on CCR Production, but not on the test instance. This needs to be tested to verify whether it causes problems during uninstalling a package: see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1040 for details).",
        "The verifier runs normally on a scheduled timer on each approved package after x amount of days, if this run changes the status of the package after it have been listed this change will not be reflected in the search results and on Chocolatey CLI results until the index have been manually re-indexed.",
        "When searching for the package `git` the package bcc-msbuildlog is showing up, which do not have git as part of the identifier, the tag, or in the description. It however have the tag GitHub in that specific casing which probably splits the word based on the case. For tags we should probably not split it and only expect exact matches instead (found during a call to `choco search git –all-versions`). There are other packages incorrectly matching as well.\n\n- [dotnet-script](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnet.script) - Uses a full url to the github tag instead of correctly tagging the package.\n- [bcc-msbuildlog](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-msbuildlog/0.1.9) - Uses GitHub as a tag, which incorrectly matches (probably due to splitting on case difference).\n- [bcc-submission](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-submission/0.1.3) - Uses GitHub as a tag as well\n- [atom](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/atom/1.51.0) - Uses GitHub as a tag, as well as GitHub Inc in the software authors (uncertain if the software author should have matched).\n- And more (5606 matches was found, not going through all of them)...",
        "Using the search term `id:firefox` on the website do not boost the exact identifier match to the top. Instead `firefox-nightly` is shown first. Removing `id:` shows the exact match first.",
        "When calling the API the returned results may change depending on the order being used (not talking about the order changing itself, but the amount of results returned), a similar thing happens on the production website, so mainly leaving it here so we are aware of it to look into in the future.\n\n- When calling the command `choco list --by-id-only --id-starts-with`` the API will return 25 packages found.\n- When calling the command `choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with --order-by-popularity` only 5 packages will be found.",
        "**Possible Enhancement**: If you try to combine search modifiers, it has unexpected results. (today the search modifiers tested don\u0027t exist)\n\n- If you search for `intune author:microsoft` it will search for an author of `intune microsoft`.\n- Similarly if you search for `tag:terminal wez` it searches for the tag `terminal wez`.",
        "**Possible Enhancement**: If you search for `choco` the results that show up have several packages that contain an example of how to call Chocolatey using the package parameters. Considering this, it might be worth it to include a stop word for purely the description to ignore the word `choco` completely.",
        "**Possible Enhancement**: If a package contains `[Deprecated]` in the title, a negative boost should probably be applied to make sure it is listed as low as possible. Or possibly just don\u0027t index such packages."
