{"title":"CCR API Tests for Elastic Search","details":"Testing new Elastic Search feature using chocolatey API calls","notes":["When calling the API returned results may change depending on the order being used (not talking about the ordering itself), a similar thing happens on the production website, so mainly leaving it here so we are aware of it to look into in the future.\n\n- When calling the command \u0060choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with\u0060 the API will return 25 packages found.\n- When calling the command \u0060choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with --order-by-popularity\u0060 only 5 packages will be found.","If you search for \u0060choco\u0060 it finds a number of results, with chocolatey being far down the list. If you search for \u0060chocol\u0060 it finds a single result that appears to have a typo in the description.\n\n- Another example is searching for \u0060intune\u0060 and \u0060intun\u0060 (today intun returns a single result, and intune returns 0 results).","If you mouse over a result and then hit enter, it will often take you to that result instead of searching what you typed in\n\n- Example: type \u0060adobe\u0060, then mouse over \u0060adobereader\u0060 and press \u0060enter\u0060. It will try to take you to the adobe reader package.\n- Initially I thought this was happening after mousing off of the entry, but it seems to happening only if you keep the mouse over the package in question.","Software source is not included in the API results when calling \u0060choco info\u0060 (Example: \u0060choco info firefox\u0060 was used).","Identifier returned in the API results do not contain the original case of the software (\u0060choco info innosetup\u0060 for instance uses upper case \u0060I\u0060 and \u0060S\u0060 which shows up correctly on CCR Production, but not on the test instance. THis needs to be tested to verify whether it causes problems during uninstalling a package. See https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1040 for details.","The verifier runs normally on a scheduled timer on each approved package after x amount of days, if this run changes the status of the package after it have been listed this change will not be reflected in the search results and on Chocolatey CLI results until the index have been manually re-indexed.","When searching for the package \u0060git\u0060 the package \u0060bcc-msbuildlog\u0060 is showing up, which do not have git as part of the identifier, the tag or in the description. It however have the tag GitHub in that specific casing which probably splits the word based on the case. For tags we should probably not split it and only expect exact matches instead (found during a call to \u0060choco search git --all-versions\u0060). There are othre packages incorrectly matching as well.\n\n- [dotnet.script](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnet.script) - Uses a full url to the GitHub tag instead of correctly tagging the package.\n- [bcc-msbuildlog](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-msbuildlog/0.1.9) - Uses GitHub as a tag, which incorrectly matches (probably due to splitting on case difference).\n- [bcc-submission](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-submission/0.1.3) - Uses GitHub as a tag as well\n- [atom](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/atom/1.51.0) - Uses GitHub as a tag, as well as GitHub Inc in the software authors (uncertain if the software authors should have matched).\n- And more (\u00605606\u0060 matches was found, not going through all of them)...","Using the search term \u0060id:firefox\u0060 on the website do not boost the exact identifier match to the top. Instead \u0060firefox-nightly\u0060 is shown first. Removing \u0060id:\u0060 shows the exact match first.","When calling the API the returned results may change depending on the order being used (not talking about the order changing itself, but the amount of results returned), a similar thing happens on the production website, so mainly leaving it here so we are aware of it to look into in the future.\n\n- When calling the command \u0060choco list --by-id-only --id-starts-with\u0060 the API will return 25 packages found.\n- When calling the command \u0060choco list chocolatey --by-id-only --id-starts-with --order-by-popularity\u0060 only 5 packages will be found.","**Possible Enhancement**: If you try to combine search modifiers, it has unexpected results. (today the search modifiers tested don\u2019t exist)\n\n- If you search for \u0060intune author:microsoft\u0060 it will search for an author of \u0060intune microsoft\u0060.\n- Similarly if you search for \u0060tag:terminal wez\u0060 it searches for the tag \u0060terminal wez\u0060.","**Possible Enhancement**: If you search for \u0060choco\u0060 the results that show up have several packages that contain an example of how to call Chocolatey using the package parameters. Considering this, it might be worth it to include a stop word purely for the description to ignore the word \u0060choco\u0060 completely.","**Possible Enhancement**: If the package contains \u0060[Deprecated]\u0060 in the title, a negative boost should probably be applied to make sure it is listed as low as possible. Or possibly just don\u0027t index such packages"],"tests":[{"name":"Normal search for Firefox","command":"choco search firefox","details":"The differences in the log between production and the test instance is believed to be due to caching on the production site.

Some of those packages are [dotnet-script](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnet-script), [bcc-msbuildlog](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-msbuildlog), [bcc-submission](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bcc-submission) and [atom](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/atom). These packages do not have an exact match for \u0060git\u0060, but instead as part of one of the other tags (\u0060GitHub\u0060, full URL in the tag), although atom also have \u0060GitHub Inc.\u0060 as the software author which could potentially match. In total \u00605606\u0060 matches was found for this search, which seems a bit high but most of these could possibly have the word \u0060git\u0060 in the description.","content":"Chocolatey
